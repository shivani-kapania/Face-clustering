# Face-clustering

In face clustering we need to perform unsupervised learning â€” we have only the faces themselves with no names/labels. From there we need to identify and count the number of unique people in a dataset.

* Encode_faces.ipynb: To extract, quantify and encode the faces in a dataset.
* Cluster_faces.ipynb: To cluster the faces, where each resulting cluster (ideally) represents a unique individual. 

## Dependencies ## 

* OpenCV
* dlib
* face_recognition
* scikit-learn
